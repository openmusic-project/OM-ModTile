# OM-ModTile

This library allows to create, modify, visualize and experiment with modulo 2 compact rhythmic canons. 

Every completion is based on a greedy algorithm, and given an inner rhythm creates the smaller outer rhythm to obtain a mod 2 compact canon. 

Rhythms are represented by lists of integers symbolizing the onsets.
